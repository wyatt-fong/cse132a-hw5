-- Problem 3: Explanation (2-5 sentences) of your optimizations goes here.

I applied selection pushdown by pushing c.region = 'West', o.amount > 200, and p.category LIKE 'Electronics%' directly
 to their respective base relations, reducing the number of tuples before any joins occur. Next, I applied projection
 pushdown so each relation keeps only attributes needed for joins or final output (e.g., Customer keeps cid and cname,
 Product keeps pid and pname), which reduces tuple width and makes joins more efficient. For join reordering, I grouped
 the selective relations into two smaller joins—(Customer ⋈ Orders) and (OrderItem ⋈ Product)—and then joined these
 results, since joining filtered tables first minimizes intermediate result sizes while still respecting the join
 graph. Join minimization showed that all joins are required because each table contributes either necessary join
 keys or output attributes. Overall, the optimized plan reduces the number of rows and columns processed at each stage,
 lowers join costs, and produces a more efficient execution plan.
