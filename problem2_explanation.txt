-- Problem 2: Explanation (2-5 sentences) of your optimizations goes here.

I applied selection pushdown to filter tuples early by pushing major = 'CS' to the Student table and dept = 'CS' to
 the Course table, reducing downstream join sizes. I then rewrote the correlated EXISTS subquery as a semijoin,
 which avoids constructing unnecessary join results and keeps only students who have at least one matching enrollment
 in a CS course. Projection pushdown was applied to keep only the attributes needed for joins or final output
 (sid, sname for Student; sid, cid for Enrollment; cid, dept for Course), reducing tuple width and memory usage.
 No beneficial join reordering was possible because the Enrollment–Course join must occur before the semijoin with
 Student, and each relation is required for predicates, join keys, or output. Overall, these optimizations reduce both
 the number of tuples and the number of attributes processed, resulting in a more efficient plan.
