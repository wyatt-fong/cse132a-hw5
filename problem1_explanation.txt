-- Problem 1: Explanation (2-5 sentences) of your optimizations goes here.

I applied selection pushdown to reduce the number of tuples early by pushing each σ to the base relation where its
 attributes originate. This reduces the cost of all downstream joins.

I applied projection pushdown to remove unnecessary attributes early. Each base relation keeps only attributes needed
 for output, selections, or join conditions, reducing tuple width and memory requirements during joins.

I applied join reordering using associativity and commutativity. After pushdown, DEPARTMENT, PROJECT, and EMPLOYEE
 are small, while ASSIGNMENT is large. The optimal legal join order is to join selective relations first and delay
 joining ASSIGNMENT. EMPLOYEE must follow ASSIGNMENT due to the join key.

Join minimization found that all joins are required, because ASSIGNMENT is needed to connect PROJECT and EMPLOYEE,
 and each table contributes essential attributes for filtering or final output.

Overall, the optimized plan is better because it minimizes intermediate relation sizes both in terms of number of
 rows (via selection pushdown) and column width (via projection pushdown), while keeping the join order that minimizes
 the size of intermediate join results.
